# Weather & GIS Data API

## Overview
A Django REST Framework project that exposes APIs to access and process meteorological and GIS data stored on the server.  
Instead of using a traditional database, this system directly interacts with output files (JSON, PNG, NCL results) generated by external weather models.  
It provides endpoints for retrieving real-time weather data, generating plots, and running scientific scripts on demand.

## Features
- **Station Data API**: Reads JSON weather files from the server and returns key parameters (temperature, humidity, wind, visibility, etc.)  
- **Date API**: Lists available forecast cycles and their corresponding dates  
- **Parameter Images**: Serves weather parameter plots (PNG files) dynamically  
- **Sounding View**: Runs an external **NCL/Skew-T script** to generate atmospheric soundings based on coordinates and model cycle  
- **Cross-Section View**: Executes custom **NCL scripts** to generate vertical cross-sections of weather data  
- **Raw Script Execution**: Ability to trigger scientific scripts (NCL) remotely from the API

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework (DRF)  
- **External Tools:** NCL scripts, Bash scripts  
- **Data Format:** JSON, PNG, NetCDF outputs from WRF models  
- **Deployment Environment:** Linux server with scientific weather model outputs  

## Problem Solved
This project bridges the gap between **raw scientific model outputs** and **end-user applications**.  
Instead of manually browsing server files, meteorological data is exposed via clean REST APIs, making it easier to:  
- Retrieve processed weather station data  
- Automate plot generation (maps, soundings, cross-sections)  
- Integrate scientific model outputs into GIS/web applications  

## In Progress / Upcoming Improvements 
- Add **Celery + Redis** for async processing of heavy scripts  
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for better API visibility
